# Google Earth Pro: Find out which points are inside which polygons.

## Instructions

1. Install Python 3.x and the pandas library
2. Draw your points and polygons in Google Earth Pro. Save all of it in a file named PP.kml (save everything under one folder -> right click -> "Save place as"). Save it in the same directory as the python script. Do __not__ use the .kmz format.
3. With your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved both the python script and PP.kml, and run the script using:
```
python PointInPolygon.py
```
4. The program will produce a file named PP.csv file in that directory, containing a table detailing which points are inside which polygons.

__Alternatively, an Excel file with the same funciontality is also attached, with instructions.__

Sample files are included (PP.kml and PP.csv), so you can demo this.
