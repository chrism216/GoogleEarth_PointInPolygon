# Google Earth Pro: Find out which points are inside which polygons.

## Instructions

1. Install Python 3.x and the pandas library
2. Draw your points and polygons in [Google Earth Pro] (https://www.google.com/earth/desktop/), which is freely available for download.
3. Save it in a file named PP.kml and place it in the same directory as the python script. Do not use the .kmz format.
4. With your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved both the python script and PP.kml, and run the script using:
```
python PointInPolygon.py
```
5. The program will produce a .csv file in that directory, containing a table detailing which points are inside which polygons.

Alternatively, an Excel file with the same funciontality is also attached, with instructions.
